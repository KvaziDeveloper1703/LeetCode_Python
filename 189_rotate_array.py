'''
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is a non-negative integer.
The rotation should be done in-place, meaning you should modify the input array directly without using extra space for another array.

Examples:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3
Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Input: nums = [-1, -100, 3, 99], k = 2
Output: [3, 99, -1, -100]
