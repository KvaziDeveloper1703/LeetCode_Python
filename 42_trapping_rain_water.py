'''
You are given an array height consisting of n non-negative integers. Each element represents the height of a vertical bar in an elevation map, and the width of each bar is 1.
After it rains, water may get trapped between the bars. Your task is to compute how many units of water can be trapped.

Examples:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if not height:
            return 0

        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        left_max, right_max = 0, 0
        water = 0

        while left < right:
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                if height[left] >= left_max:
                    left_max = height[left]
                else:
                    water += left_max - height[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                if height[right] >= right_max:
                    right_max = height[right]
                else:
                    water += right_max - height[right]
                right -= 1

        return water
