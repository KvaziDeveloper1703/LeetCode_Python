'''
You are given two integer arrays, numbers_1 and numbers_2, both sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers, m and n, representing the number of valid elements in numbers_1 and numbers_2, respectively.
Your task is to merge numbers_2 into numbers_1 as one sorted array in-place.
+ numbers_1 has a length of m + n, where:
    + The first m elements contain the elements to be merged;
    + The last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored.
+ number_s2 has exactly n elements.

Requirements:
+ Merge numbers_2 into numbers_1, so that numbers_1 becomes a sorted array of size m + n.
+ Do not return the merged array â€” modify numbers_1 in-place.

Examples:
Input: numbers_1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, numbers_2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: numbers_1 = [1,2,2,3,5,6]
